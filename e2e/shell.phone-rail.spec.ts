// B4 (docs/usability.md §4/§3.8, z-index part only): "Phone: tool rail beneath the sheet at every
// detent" -- the sheet's `.panel-region` (z-index 16) sat at `bottom: 0`, the SAME row the tool
// rail (`.rail-region`, z-index 15) floats over at `bottom: var(--space-3)`; at every detent (even
// "peek", 96 px tall) the sheet's own box covered the rail's footprint and intercepted every tap
// meant for it. Only the Layers tool (selected by default, no tap needed) was reachable on a
// phone. Root cause + fix: src/shell/shell.css's `.panel-region` phone rule now reserves the
// rail's own row (`--size-rail-row`, built from the SAME tokens Rail.svelte/HexButton size the
// rail with, so it can never drift), and src/lib/ui/Sheet.svelte's `detent-full` rule shrinks to
// fit above it instead of growing back down over the reserved row.
//
// This is a REAL Playwright `.click()`, not a synthetic dispatch: Playwright's own actionability
// checks refuse to click a target another element visually covers, which is exactly how this bug
// reproduces red on the unfixed CSS (a timeout, matching the assessment's own "tapping 'Places'
// timed out with the sheet's content intercepting the tap").
//
// The phone species search (m1-adjacent, a different owner) is out of scope here -- this spec only
// taps the Places rail item and reads the sheet's own title, never species state.
