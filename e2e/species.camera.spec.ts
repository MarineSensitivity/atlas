// D8 (Opus 5.5 eyes-on assessment, 2026-09-24, atlas-refs/"2026-09-24 eyes-on UI assessment
// (Opus 5.5) on 15d6e4c.md"): "?lens=species&mdl_seq=54383 (walrus) the range is a sliver on the
// globe's limb ... 95% of the frame is empty continent." Two real, distinct causes, fixed
// separately in src/lens/species/data/camera.ts + state.svelte.ts:
//
//   1. v9's `am` walrus input (`WALRUS_AM_MDL_KEY`, `am|ITS-Mam-180639`) publishes `bbox: null` on
//      itself AND on `card.merged`, while the SAME taxon's `ax` sibling carries a real one
//      (`tests/fixtures/species/v9/taxon/75.json`) — `cameraFor()`'s new "sibling" step fixes this
//      with NO network call at all.
//   2. v7's walrus (`mdl_seq=54383`) publishes NO bbox anywhere (every asset's `bbox` is null,
//      `assets: []`) — `state.svelte.ts#refineCameraFromCogBounds` asks titiler's own `/cog/info`
//      (NOT `/cog/bounds`, which 404s live on titiler-v8 — verified; see `src/lib/raster/bounds.ts`'s
//      own header) for the drawn COG's extent as the true last resort. The real walrus v7 COG's own
//      `/cog/info` bounds are a degenerate whole-360-degree-longitude span
//      (`[-180, 53.15, 180, 73.75]`), so this test also exercises `narrowLongitude`'s point-probe
//      narrowing (real value: only lon -170 holds data), not just a plain pass-through bbox.

/**
 * CI flakiness fix (orchestrator addendum, 2026-09-25, real CI run 36158947685): waits for the
 * camera to reach a genuinely settled resting state, without assuming anything about WHEN the fit
 * that gets it there starts or finishes relative to the first poll tick. Two failure modes this
 * replaces, both real, both caught by three-engine CI:
 *   - a plain numeric-threshold poll (`zoom > ceiling`, `zoom > 0`) with no settle-wait can read a
 *     value still mid-flight on a slower engine (webkit) — the flight's OWN final resting
 *     zoom/centre can differ from whatever a snapshot taken while `isMoving()` is still true
 *     happens to show.
 *   - an "isMoving() was true, then false" two-step poll can find NEITHER true, when the fit is
 *     synchronous/instant and finishes between page-load and this function's own first poll tick
 *     (`cameraFor()`'s bundle-only chain returns a bounds camera with no async step in between) --
 *     "the camera never started flying" even though it already correctly arrived.
 * Requires the SAME reading twice in a row (never moving in between) before calling it settled, so
 * a transient one-frame lull mid-animation is not mistaken for the end.

  // arrive) and the species' own camera fit, including this COG-bounds last resort, was silently
  // skipped for the rest of the session. Reproduces the live race with a deliberately delayed
