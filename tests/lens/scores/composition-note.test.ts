// G-23 (2) fix (docs/parity.html) -- mislabelled "G-24" at the time (corrected atlas-8 phase
// review M8, 0.10.24: this is G-23's SECOND defect, the stale bird note beside its summary-line
// defect, not the unrelated G-24 zones-table-header issue). A ported note above the composition
// treemap used to read "the 'bird' component has yet to be added to this visualization" -- true
// of the SHINY app's six-rank WoRMS hierarchy treemap (its `inner_join` against `d_taxonomy`
// drops BOTW taxa, which carry no WoRMS row -- G-06, not built here), but never true of the
// ONE-LEVEL treemap this repo ships (`composition.ts#compositionTree` groups by `sp_cat` via a
// LEFT JOIN, `sql/composition.sql`, so a bird row is never excluded by construction).
//
// Two things are asserted: (1) a plain source scan, the same technique
// `tests/shell/documentTitle.test.ts` / `tests/treemap-lazy-import.wiring.test.ts` use for a
// property a real DOM render can't observe under vitest's node environment -- the literal note
// text must never reappear in `Composition.svelte`. (2) the DATA claim the removal rests on: real
// release fixtures (v7 AND v9) carry `sp_cat: "bird"` rows, and `compositionTree()` (already
// unit-tested on its own in composition.test.ts) turns any category with a positive sum into a
// box -- bird included, exactly like every other category.
