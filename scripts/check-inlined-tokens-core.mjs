// atlas-3 step 3: index.html's inlined critical CSS `@import`s src/shell/shell.css, which itself
// `@import`s src/lib/brand/tokens.css -- Vite's html/CSS pipeline resolves both at dev/build time
// and inlines the resolved (and, in a real build, minified) declarations directly into the page's
// `<style>` tag. That is the "build step" the review checklist requires: nobody hand-types a token
// value into index.html. This module is the mechanical proof that the copy is faithful: it re-parses
// a built dist/index.html's inlined `<style>` and confirms every custom property tokens.css declares
// still resolves to the SAME value there, in every theme block.
//
// Values are compared through `normalizeCssValue`, not by byte equality, because a production build
// minifies the inlined CSS (lightningcss): "0.1" is rewritten to ".1", "150ms" to ".15s",
// "#ffffff" to "#fff", and comma-separated function args lose their surrounding whitespace. None
// of that is drift -- it is the same value, differently serialized -- so both sides are normalized
// (case, whitespace, hex shorthand, a redundant leading zero, and a bare time unit) before
// comparing. A REAL value change (a hand-typed override that disagrees with tokens.css) still shows
// up as a normalized mismatch.
//
// This module parses CSS itself rather than reusing scripts/contrast-core.mjs's `parseThemes`,
// because that parser is only ever driven against hand-authored, semicolon-terminated tokens.css --
// it has never had to survive a minifier, which (a) drops the semicolon before a rule's closing
// `}` (so a naive `/(--[\w-]+):([^;]+);/` misses exactly the LAST declaration of every rule) and
// (b) leaves `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { :root { ... } }` nested, which that
// parser's single-level brace scan reads as a second, unguarded top-level `:root` block. Both are
// harmless to `contrast.mjs` (neither affects a token in its contrast pairs) but would silently
// corrupt THIS check, so `parseTokenBlocks` below fixes both, independently of that file.
