// The species lens' data layer, part 3: the deep-link resolver.
//
// WHAT HAS TO KEEP WORKING (`atlas-refs/"parity species app.md"` §4, §9):
//   - `?mdl_key=ms_merge|WORMS:137209` — a merged key, as the scores app emits it (URL-encoded there,
//     raw when the old app wrote it back: `|` and `:` go in unescaped).
//   - `?mdl_key=am|Rep-3437` — ANY raw input key, which must land on the taxon AND select that input.
//   - `?mdl_seq=54383` — the v1-v7b integer id, published in the BOEM final report and its
//     deliverables. Those links are in PDFs that cannot be re-issued; they resolve or they are dead.
//   - a target that is not US-valid turns the "Only species in US waters" checkbox OFF, or the taxon
//     it just resolved to would not be in the list the picker is showing.
//
// HOW. One `alias/{xx}.json` fetch (shards.ts), no DuckDB, no scan of the picker index. The alias
// shard carries every raw input key AND every legacy `mdl_seq`, and the merged key itself maps to
// `[merged_key, "ms_merge"]` — so one lookup answers all three cases, and the kind of answer is
// exactly the `resolution` the analytics event has always recorded.
//
// ORDER OF PRECEDENCE matches state/legacy.ts (`mdl_key` beats `mdl_seq`, and a modern `sp=` beats
// both): a legacy id is only ever a fallback for a link that does not already say `sp`.
