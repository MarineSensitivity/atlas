// atlas-4/0.10.21 fix 1 — the scores lens' MAP-INPUT ownership, split out of `ScoresLens.svelte`
// (the panel body) so it does not depend on the panel being open. Mirrors the species lens' own
// split (`src/lens/species/state.svelte.ts`): this is the ONE `.svelte.ts` wiring module — plain
// runes, no `.svelte` component imported — that derives `mapExtra` (the `composeStyle()`
// contribution: zones/raster/overlays/selection/legend) from `sel`/`boot`/`manifest`, so
// Shell.svelte can read it whenever `sel.lens === "scores"` REGARDLESS of whether the panel/sheet
// happens to have mounted `ScoresLens.svelte` at all.
//
// The bug this fixes (owner's report, live 0.10.17): `Panel.svelte` renders its children only
// while `!geometry.collapsed` (desktop only — `Sheet.svelte`'s phone body always renders, just
// CSS-hidden at "peek"), and the scores panel's body used to be the ONLY place `scoresMapInputs()`
// ever ran (a `$effect` inside `ScoresLens.svelte` writing a `bind:mapExtra` prop). Collapse the
// desktop panel and that component is never mounted at all, so `mapExtra` stays `{}` forever and
// `composeStyle()` gets `raster: null` — the score raster (and the floating legend) never paints,
// even though the map itself is fully visible.
//
// Shell.svelte loads this module the SAME way it loads `ScoresLens.svelte`/`ScoresLegend.svelte` —
// a dynamic `import()` triggered by `sel.lens === "scores"`, never by the panel/tool — so a
// species-only session still never downloads a byte of this (`tests/shell/lazy-lens-imports.test.ts`'s
// spirit, even though that scan only polices `.svelte` SFCs by name: this module pulls in
// `mapInputs.ts`/`boot.ts`/`raster.ts`/`zoneFill.ts`, which is exactly the weight D13's fix moved
// OUT of the static bundle in the first place).
//
// atlas-8 review round 2, item M1 (the SAME class of bug, moved one layer down): the click
// handler, the `sel=` selection write and the popup lived in `ScoresLens.svelte` too — mounted
// ONLY inside the panel body, so a click did nothing with the desktop panel collapsed or the
// Places tool open (species wires its click at Shell level; scores did not). `handleMapClick`
// below is that same fix applied to clicks: a lens-level owner Shell.svelte calls from its ONE
// `map.on("click", ...)` listener (mirroring `src/lens/species/state.svelte.ts#handleMapClick`),
// regardless of which tool/panel is open. usability M9: the popup opens AT ONCE with a "Loading
// value…" line (`popup.ts#cellPopupLoadingText`) and is filled in once the engine answers, rather
// than staying invisible for however long the click-to-value round trip takes (observed: no
// popup for > 3.5s).
//
// `ScoresLens.svelte` still owns everything that needs the PANEL to exist at all — the clicked
// cell's flower fetch, the species/zones table — it just READS this module's `unit`/`lyr`/
// `selection`/`mapSelection`/`showOutsidePra`/`mapExtra` instead of recomputing them, and writes
// user choices back through `selStore` exactly as before (every choice is already in the URL —
// `showOutsidePra` is the one exception, ephemeral chrome same as `Panel.svelte`'s own geometry,
// so it lives here as plain `$state` rather than round-tripping through `sel`).

 *
 * W6 fix (Ben's live-site report, 2026-09-25): "a SECOND Program-Area search pick does not zoom."
 * This USED to query `querySourceFeatures` FILTERED to the one key just asked for -- MapLibre only
 * answers that from tiles loaded for the CURRENT viewport, and the first pick's own `flyToBounds`
 * had already zoomed the camera in tight on the first zone, so the second zone's tile (elsewhere on

 * after the first — reproduced exactly with the e2e fixture (two far-apart Program Areas): pick 1
 * zooms, pick 2 does not, matching the live report. The first pick only ever "worked" because the
 * app's initial wide default camera happens to have every Program Area's outline already loaded
 * (`layerStack.ts`'s "Outlines" group is always-on chrome).
 *
 * The fix: query UNFILTERED (`zoneBboxesByKeyFromFeatures`, `places/zoneStats.ts`) and cache EVERY
 * key the query happens to see, not just the one asked for -- so whichever zones were loaded at the
 * moment of the FIRST query (normally all of them, at the initial wide camera) are cached for every
 * LATER pick, with no live query needed at all. `zoneBoundsCache` is created once per
 * `createScoresLens()` call (this module's own header: "runs exactly ONCE per page load"), so it is
