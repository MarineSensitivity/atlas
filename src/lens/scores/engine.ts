// regression this fixes), which makes it routine for TWO callers to reach this function around the
// same moment -- the click's own `showCellPopup` value fetch AND `ScoresLens.svelte`'s
// `cellFlowerRows` effect, which reacts to `sel` changing to `kind: "cell"` the instant it is
// written, not once a value has already resolved. The old code checked the RESOLVED `sources`
// synchronously (`if (sources && sourcesVer === ver) return sources`) and awaited `loadModules()`
// (itself correctly promise-memoized) before ever assigning `sources` -- so two concurrent callers
// for the SAME `ver`, both arriving before the first had finished, each saw `sources` still `null`
// and each built its OWN `new Engine()`, racing to install DuckDB-WASM's `parquet` extension
// independently (observed failure: "Extension Autoloading Error ... parquet"). Memoizing the
// PROMISE closes that gap: a second concurrent caller awaits the SAME in-flight boot instead of
// starting a second one.
