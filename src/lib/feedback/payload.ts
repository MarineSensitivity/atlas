// U3 "Send feedback" (round 2, replaces atlas-8 Deliverable 4's "Report a problem"): the pure
// payload builder FeedbackDialog.svelte posts to `VITE_FEEDBACK_URL` -- the exact shape
// `scripts/feedback/Code.gs` expects (docs/feedback.md's runbook). Kept here, not inline in the
// component, so a test asserts the exact shape without mounting anything
// (CLAUDE.md: "keep core logic in an exported function under src/lib/ ... a component calls it").
//
// The privacy rule (plan D8, the same one issueUrl.ts already enforces for the old control): the
// "include my current view link" checkbox is OFF by default, and when it is off the `url` field is
// not merely hash-stripped -- it is ABSENT from the payload entirely, so nothing about the page
// (not even the query) leaves the device unless the user opts in. `hash` (the raw `#...` fragment)
// is a SEPARATE input from `pageUrl` for the identical reason issueUrl.ts's `PageLocationLike` has
// no `hash` field: this module must never read the live location global itself.
// tests/feedback/noHash.test.ts's source scan already covers every file under src/lib/feedback/,
// so this file has to stay honest on its own -- it never references the live `location` global,
// by any spelling, anywhere (not even in a comment).
