// report/model.ts -- atlas-7 step 1: ONE pure function from (release, places) to a plain object
// whose every number equals what R produces for the same places.
//
// WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. `buildReport()` fetches nothing, queries nothing and is
// synchronous: the caller hands it the queries it already ran (`ReportPlaceInput.scores` /
// `.species`), and every one of those fields is nullable so the document can render a section the
// moment its data lands and show the rest as pending (atlas-7 step 2's progressive rendering). The
// model's whole job is DERIVATION -- the ramp domain, the flowers, the scores table and its
// footnotes, the species cross-tab, the top 20, the provenance -- and derivation is exactly what a
// unit test can hold against R (`tests/lib/report/numbers.test.ts` against
// `tests/fixtures/report/{v7,v9}/report_*.json`).
//
// NOTHING HERE IS A SECOND COPY (the phase's review checklist). The flowers go through the lens's
// own `dedupeFlowerComponents()` + `computeFlowerGeometrySafe()`; the categories through
// `lib/ui/categories.ts`; the permalink and the Species-lens deep links through
// `lib/state/codec.ts#formatSel`; the citations through the one `lib/release/cite.ts` path (new in
// this phase -- see that file's header for why it is not under `report/`); the component labels
// through `lens/scores/flower.ts#componentLabel`. The SQL twins are not read here at all: the
// caller ran them.
//
// TWO NUMBERS THAT LOOK LIKE ONE, and a decision about them:
//  1. A ZONE place reports its release's PUBLISHED `zone_metric` rows; the SAME area traced as a
//     custom place reports the D7b-clipped blend over its own cells. They differ -- measured on
//     v9 GAA, 40.4484 published vs 40.4982 traced (+0.0498), which is `tests/fixtures/report/v9/
//     report_gaa.json`'s `traced_as_custom_place` block. That is the boundary-vs-grid difference
//     master plan D7b bounded ("a traced Program Area still reproduces its published composite
//     within 0.08 points"), not a defect, and the fixture records both so a reader can see which
//     kind of place produced which number.
//  2. The flower DRAWS one petal per resolved category, so v8/v9's `primary producer` and
//     `primprod` collapse to one slot (`lens/scores/flower.ts`'s header). The Table of Scores keeps
//     both, because both genuinely feed the composite. The flower's CENTRE is therefore taken from
//     the table's `Overall` (all components), NOT from the drawn petals' own mean: a document whose
//     flower centre and whose table disagree by 4 points is a defect whatever the reason. The
//     petals' own mean is still reported, as `centreOfDrawnPetals`, and `droppedLabels` names what
//     the ring could not show.
