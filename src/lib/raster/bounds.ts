// D8 (Opus 5.5 eyes-on, 2026-09-24; orchestrator round 2, real-v7-build eyes-on): the LAST resort
// in the species camera's fallback chain, for a taxon that publishes NO bbox on any input or on
// `card.merged` at all — measured on v7 (every asset's `bbox` is `null`, `assets: []` on the
// walrus, mdl_seq 54383; camera.ts's own header: "v7 publishes no bbox at all"). `camera.ts` itself
// stays network-free by contract (its own header: "WHY THERE IS NO QUERY HERE"), so this is a
// SEPARATE module the species lens' wiring (`state.svelte.ts`) calls only once camera.ts's own
// bundle-only chain has already fallen to the study area.
//
// ROUND 2 (real build): the round-1 version of this file called stock titiler's `/cog/bounds` —
// verified LIVE against titiler-v8 to 404 ("Not Found"; that route is not registered on this
// deployment). `/cog/info` IS live (verified: 200, `{bounds:[...], width, height, ...}`) and its
// `bounds` field is what this module now reads.
//
// A SECOND, real problem `/cog/info`'s bounds alone does not solve: the walrus's own v7 merged COG
// reports `bounds: [-180, 53.15, 180, 73.75]` — a genuinely FULL 360-degree longitude span, not a
// metadata artifact. Verified with `/cog/point` samples along that latitude: only ONE of fourteen
// longitudes tried (-170) held real data; every other (-160 through 170, spanning the rest of the
// globe) answered `null`. The file's own extent is honestly whole-longitude/narrow-latitude (a
// usa05-grid COG the publish pipeline never cropped past a shared latitude band), so `/cog/info`
// alone would frame the entire globe's width at a thin Arctic band — not the range. `narrowLongitude`
// below is the fix: when the info bbox's longitude span is degenerate (`bboxSpansGlobe`-wide),
// probe a SMALL, FIXED set of candidate longitudes (the real US EEZ's own rough footprint — Aleutians
// through the Gulf/Atlantic/Caribbean/Hawaii/CNMI, the same regions `boot.study_areas` already names)
// at the bbox's own latitude midpoint via `/cog/point` (plan D4's one sanctioned tile-server read for
// species values — this reuses that exact endpoint, never a new one), and once ANY of them hits real
// data, frames a MODEST window around it rather than the file's own (correct but useless) full width.
// Bounded cost (at most `CANDIDATE_LONS.length` extra requests, fired only on this already-rare
// last-resort path) and an honest approximation — documented as such, never claimed to be exact.
//
// R3-rr fix 1, round 2 (2026-09-25, real-build eyes-on): the walrus is ONE compact location, but
// not every degenerate COG is -- the leatherback (mdl_seq 54241) holds real data at FOUR widely
// separated candidates (Aleutians, Atlantic/Caribbean, Hawaii, Guam/CNMI), a genuinely wide-ranging
// species a single "modest window" cannot honestly frame. `narrowLongitude` now probes every
// candidate (not just the first hit) and, when the hits are spread wide (`multiRegionSpread` past
// `MULTI_REGION_SPREAD_DEG`), hands the RAW degenerate bbox back instead of a narrow window --
// letting `camera.ts#cogBoundsCamera`'s own wide-range/US-study-area narrowing (already fixed in
// round 1, for a bundle-published globe-spanning bbox) apply here too, "Whole range" toggle and all.
