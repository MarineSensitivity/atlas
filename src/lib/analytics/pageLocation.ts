// they cannot reach a server, a referrer header, or analytics (plan D8, master-plan first table's
// privacy row: "geometry never leaves the browser, not even to analytics"). `LocationLike`
// deliberately has no field for that fragment, so even a caller that hands this a real, live page
// location object (which does carry one) gets a compile-time guarantee this module never reads it.
// tests/analytics/noRawLocation.wiring.test.ts is the source-scan gate that keeps every file in this
// directory off the live global entirely, not just this one interface.
//
// The allow-list is state/types.ts's own `QUERY_KEYS` — the exact list of query keys `Sel` ever
// writes (state/'s header: "Query holds short, non-sensitive scalars") — imported rather than
// duplicated so the two cannot drift apart. `HASH_KEYS` (`pl`, `t`) never appears here because this
// module never even looks at the fragment.
