// gazetteer/config.ts -- where the Ocean Metrics places gazetteer lives, and the one credit line the
// atlas can always say about it. Tiny and dependency-free ON PURPOSE: the map shell (static graph)
// imports this file; everything that pulls in hyparquet is in ./resolve.ts, reached by dynamic
// import() only (scripts/size-budget-core.mjs forbids "hyparquet" in the entry's static graph).
//
// TWO BASES, ONE TREE. The published root is https://storage.oceanmetrics.io/gazetteer/, but that
// host answers every object request with a 302 to the S3 bucket, INCLUDING the CORS preflight a
// cross-origin `Range` read triggers (checked 2026-10-08: `OPTIONS` -> 302), and a browser refuses a
// redirected preflight. Parquet row-group reads and PMTiles are all `Range` reads, so the app reads
// the bucket URL directly, exactly as `marine-atlas/` data does (src/lib/release/dataBase.ts) and as
// erddap-places' Then-vs-Now does. `GAZETTEER_ROOT` is the canonical, human-facing address (used in
// docs, citations and the credit link); `GAZETTEER_DATA_BASE` is what is fetched. Override both with
// `VITE_GAZETTEER_BASE` (a staging copy of the tree); the trailing slash is optional.
