// maps each `kind` to the actual DOM action (`mapCapture.ts`/`cogDownload.ts`/`places/download.ts`)
// -- this module decides only WHICH items exist and whether each is enabled, never how to execute
// one (a canvas/fetch call has no business being "pure").

 * `boot.json`/the manifest today (`src/lib/zones/programAreaNames.ts`'s own header note: the
 * canonical geometry lives only in a laptop-side `.gpkg`, never published to the bundle) -- the
 * brief's own instruction is to leave the item out rather than fake it from loaded PMTiles tiles,
 * which would silently ship a viewport-cropped "complete" geometry. See this round's report for
