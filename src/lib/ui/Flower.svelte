  // atlas-4 fix round 3 (owner, phone/dark/Scores/Flower, cell 3092526, 2026-09-24): three defects
  // in the SAME panel. (1) the figure was not centred in `.flower-panel` -- `.flower`'s own default
  // flex `align-items: stretch` fills up to `max-width` and then sits flush at the cross-axis
  // START the moment the panel is wider than that cap, rather than centering the capped box in the
  // leftover space (`margin: 0 auto` below fixes the figure itself; `.flower-body`'s own
  // `align-items: center` fixes the <svg> -- a default-`display: inline` replaced element that
  // never centered itself inside its own full-width wrapper). (2) tabbing to/tapping a petal drew
  // a SOLID RECTANGLE -- `outline` on an SVG `<path>` always paints the element's BOUNDING BOX, not
  // its actual annular-sector shape, no matter what color it is set to; replaced with a purpose-
  // drawn `stroke` highlight, which (unlike `outline`) follows the path's own geometry. (3) the
  // table (added atlas-4 fix round 2, "component | score") was toggle-hidden behind a "Show table"
  // button, so by default only the always-visible `.summary` PROSE sentence carried the numbers --
  // the toggle is gone; chart and table are both always shown, and `.summary` becomes the SCREEN-
  // READER-ONLY text alternative the table's own `<caption>`/`<th>` headers no longer need
  // duplicated visibly (a `<table>` with real headers already satisfies "every chart has a table
  // equivalent" on its own -- the sentence stays only for SC 1.1.1's separate "text summary").

  // the SVG now GROWS to fill its container up to the `size` prop's cap (raised from 220 to 480) --
  // it used to carry `width`/`height` HTML attributes pinning it to a literal px value regardless of
