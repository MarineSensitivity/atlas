     both already correct; the panel's CONTENT (this whole stack, 7 sections deep with the Data
     row expanded) was measured ~26px taller than the available area, so the initial (unscrolled)
     view clipped the last ~1.5px of the footer button's own bottom border before ever reaching
     that padding -- adding padding AFTER the button cannot pull the button itself back into view,
     only reducing the space ABOVE it can. `var(--space-3)` (12px) -> `var(--space-2)` (8px)
     across the stack's own 6 section gaps recovers 24px, closing nearly all of it; combined with
     `.stack-footer`'s own added bottom padding (its comfortable-clearance half of the same fix,

     lines as a first pass. Fix round (orchestrator, 2026-09-25): line-clamping still left the
     first two rows below the fold, and the description is no longer the only copy of this text on

     pointer, `.opacity-btn`'s own rule below) or raising `--size-sheet-half` itself, a SHARED

  /* fix round (Opus 5.5 eyes-on review): "Reset layers" clipped -- measured at the docked-panel
     default (1280x800), the button's own bottom edge sat ~1.5px PAST `.panel-body`'s own
     scrollable bottom edge (Panel.svelte's `padding-bottom: var(--space-4)`, apparently consumed
     by ordinary flex-gap rounding across this panel's several sections) -- enough for the
     button's own border/corner to visibly clip in a screenshot, with no scrollbar obviously
     showing the true (barely) overflowed state. A dedicated bottom padding HERE, on top of the
     panel's own, is deliberate slack against exactly that kind of small cross-browser rounding
     drift -- never rely on a scroll container's padding landing at a sub-pixel-exact multiple of
     its content's own height. */
