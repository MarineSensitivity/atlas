// atlas-3 step 2b: the flower plot's geometry, pulled out of Flower.svelte so its hard rules are
// unit-tested directly (CLAUDE.md: core logic lives in an exported function; the component only
// calls it). Mirrors msens::ggplot_flower() (viz.R:719-829): every bar has `even = 1` (equal
// angular width, independent of score or how many components there are -- 7 on v7, 8 on v8/v9,
// parity scores app.md:826-830); centre = `weighted.mean(score, even, na.rm = TRUE)`, which with
// every weight equal to 1 IS the plain mean of the components actually present.
//
// One deliberate correction over the R app: a component with NO value is "no data", not an
// implicit 0 that `na.rm = TRUE` quietly drops from view. This module keeps that component's
// angular SLOT (so the ring's layout doesn't shift depending on which components happen to be
// present) but draws no petal in it and excludes it from the mean -- "absent is not zero"
// (docs/design/spec.md / the plan).
//
// atlas-4 fix round 2 (owner-reported defect, 2026-09-24): "Flower plot, nothing selected" on live
// v7 listed EIGHT components under a centre of 24 but drew only ~3-4 visible petals. Root cause --
// every petal used to be a full PIE SLICE from the true centre (`sectorPath(cx, cy, radius, ...)`
// with `radius = score` when `outerRadius = 100`), and `Flower.svelte`/`flowerSvg.ts` then drew a
// solid hub disc of radius 24 ON TOP to host the centre number. Any component whose score was <=
// 24 -- Coral 10.45, Fish 15.96, Invertebrate 14.73, Other 15.18, Primary producer 10.38 in the
// reported case -- produced a slice that fit ENTIRELY inside the hub and was therefore completely
// covered by it: 5 of 8 petals were real, correctly-colored, correctly-sized shapes that were
// simply painted over. This was never a color/category mapping gap (every one of the eight real
// categories, "other" included, already had a defined, distinct `--cat-*` token in tokens.css) --
// it was a z-order/radius bug that happened to look like a missing color from the screenshot.
//
// The fix mirrors what `msens::ggplot_flower()` does structurally (viz.R:779: `xlim(c(-10,
// max(height)))`, which offsets the polar axis so every bar's inner edge starts above the true
// centre, never fully covered by the centre annotation): every petal is now drawn as an ANNULAR
// SECTOR (a donut-ring wedge) from a shared `innerRadius` (matching the hub's own radius) out to a
// score-scaled outer radius, rather than a pie slice from the true centre. A real, present score
// -- however small -- always draws a visible band immediately outside the hub; only an EXACT score
// of 0 is naturally degenerate (innerRadius == outerRadius, zero-width, nothing to draw), which is
// the same "real but invisible" contract `sectorPath`'s `radius <= 0` case already had.
