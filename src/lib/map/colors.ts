// These are DATA colours, and they are not a ramp: they are the `zone_style` table msens publishes

// (atlas-4 §6.6), the binary-mask overlay's RGBA (`cog_tile_url(color = "#222222")`,
// viz.R:412-420), and the `--surface-map`/`--stroke-outline` values a WebGL background/line layer
// needs but cannot read from CSS. Every one of them is fixed by a parity reference or a design
// token, none of them encodes a value, and none may move into `src/lib/brand/tokens.css` — that
// file's rule is that a token is CHROME (spec.md §2: "brand colors are chrome; data colors are
// data"). `--stroke-outline` (R9, 2026-09-24) is the one deliberate exception alongside
// `--surface-map`: msens's own `zone_line_args()` table picks white for the programarea/planarea/
// default rows on the assumption of a dark basemap, which is a rendering/legibility choice, not a
// value the line encodes -- exactly what makes it CHROME, not data, once a light theme exists.
//
// Two gates meet here. `scripts/check-hex-literals.mjs` does not scan this directory at all
// (tokens are a brand rule). `tests/raster/ramps.wiring.test.ts` — "ramps.ts is the only ramp or
// palette definition under src/" — DOES, and it names this one file as its single map-side
// exception, with a companion assertion that nothing ramp-shaped (five or more stops) is ever
// defined here. Put a new map colour in this file or nowhere.
