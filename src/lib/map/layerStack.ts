// change the stacking of data layers (Program Areas, the score raster) relative to map layers
// (place names, bathymetry): some map layers belong on top of, some underneath, a semi-transparent
// data layer."
//
// This module is the pure, unit-tested stack MODEL — no MapLibre, no Svelte, no DOM. `style.ts`
// consumes it (composeStyle still returns ONE style object, one `setStyle(diff:true)` — CLAUDE.md's
// "one MapLibre style" rule; this is a REORDER/opacity input to that one call, never a second style
// or a second `setLayoutProperty` after the fact). `state/codec.ts` consumes its parse/format pair
// for the `layers=` URL key (plan D8/U4 Deliverable 2 — "deviations from the default stack live in
// the query"). `src/lib/ui/LayersPanel.svelte` (both lenses) renders it.
//
// Borrows CalCOFI explore's shape (`src/layers.tsx`/`src/state.ts`'s `LayerStyle[]`/`layers=`) —
// see `atlas-refs/"calcofi explore review.md"` and the round-2 plan §10 — adapted to this app's
// CARTO-merged-whole-style basemap (`style.ts#mergeCartoStyle`) instead of CalCOFI's own
// per-dataset PMTiles registry: there is no per-basemap-FEATURE registry here, only five coarse
// ROLES a merged CARTO layer is classified into (`classifyBasemapLayer`, below).

 * **M7 fix (Opus 5.5 review)**: the three DATA groups keep a FIXED relative order
 * (`data-raster < data-zones < data-places`) no matter what `from`/`to` asks for — before this fix,
 * "Selection" (`data-places`) could end up BELOW a basemap group (e.g. "Land & water"), breaking
 * the exact property R3 exists to guarantee: "the selection ring is never hidden by the layer it
 * selects" (`style.ts#LAYER_ORDER`'s own header). `data-places` is additionally PINNED: it can
 * never be `from` (an attempt to move IT returns `entries` unchanged) and nothing else can move to
 * or past its own position (so it stays the topmost entry structurally, not merely by convention).
 * Basemap groups, and `data-raster`/`data-zones` relative to basemap groups, still move freely —
 * only the DATA-vs-DATA relative order is fixed. An attempted move that would invert
 * `data-raster`/`data-zones` anyway (both still strictly below `data-places`) is rejected outright
 * (returns `entries` unchanged) rather than silently clamped to some other position — a caller
 * (the panel) is expected to disable the button that would produce it in the first place.
