// CARTO's RASTER basemaps (the two theme-named XYZ tile endpoints this file used to point at)
// started answering with an "API KEY REQUIRED" watermark tile (owner report, 2026-09-23) — CARTO
// now gates the raster endpoint behind a key. Its VECTOR GL styles do not: `.../gl/dark-matter-gl-style/
// style.json` and `.../gl/positron-gl-style/style.json` are still keyless (verified live the same
// day: 200, ~70 KB, `sources.carto` a `carto.streets` vector TileJSON, plus a sprite and a glyph
// range). That costs the extra round trips the OLD comment here warned about (style.json -> its own
// TileJSON -> vector tiles -> sprite -> glyphs) — accepted, since the raster endpoint no longer
// works at any price. `loadBasemapStyle()` fetches+caches that style.json ONCE per theme;
// `style.ts#composeStyle()` merges its `sources`/`sprite`/`glyphs`/`layers` into the ONE composed
// style (CLAUDE.md: "one MapLibre style, one setStyle(diff:true)") — never a second style object.

/**
 * Warm every theme's CARTO style AND tell the caller when each one lands, so the caller can put it

 *
 * MEASURED (Firefox, `e2e/scores.firstpaint.spec.ts`'s raster probe, 1 of 40 repeats at load ~11,
 * and deterministically with the CARTO style.json answered 3 s late): the composed style's ocean
 * pixel read `247,171,122` instead of `153,117,86` — the score raster at 0.6 opacity over the
 * theme's flat `--surface-map` colour rather than over the basemap. Ten seconds after the
 * style.json had arrived, `getStyle().layers` still held ZERO `basemap-` layers. The old policy
 * had no invalidation at all: when the fetch resolves after the last reactive change (which is
 * exactly what contention causes), the cache is warm and nothing ever reads it again, so the
 * basemap never appears — for the whole life of the page, not just late.
 *
 * The reason that invalidation was left out was real too: an extra `setStyle(diff:true)` landing
 * at a network-timed moment inside a burst of other style changes exposed a MapLibre-level
 * mis-ordering. That is now fixed where it belongs, in `map/styleQueue.ts`: at most one `setStyle`
 * is in flight at a time, so an extra recompose costs one more settle cycle and can no longer
 * produce a mis-ordered pair of diffs. Hence this helper, rather than another workaround. (0.10.22:
 * that cycle ends on the issued style's own `"style.load"`, not `"idle"`, and an identical recompose
 * — the other theme reporting in — is not issued at all; see `styleQueue.ts`'s header.)
 *
 * `onResolved` is called exactly once per theme, ALWAYS — `loadBasemapStyle()` resolves to
 * {@link EMPTY_BASEMAP_STYLE} rather than rejecting, and the rejection path is covered anyway, so a
 * caller can key its reactive state on "has this theme reported in" without ever hanging.
