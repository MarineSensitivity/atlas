// The camera ⇄ URL rule, as pure functions (CLAUDE.md "URL-is-the-view"): the map's centre, zoom
// and projection live in `?map=lon,lat,zoom[,bearing,pitch]` + `?proj=` or they live nowhere.
// `map.ts` owns the MapLibre wiring; everything decidable without a browser is here, so it is
// unit-testable under vitest's node environment.
//
// Three rules, one per function below:
//  1. ROUND before writing. A raw MapLibre centre is a 15-significant-digit float; a link a person
//     pastes should be readable, and an unrounded write makes every sub-pixel render a new URL.
//  2. Never write an unchanged camera (`cameraEqual`) — `history.replaceState` on every frame of a
//     drag is what makes a URL-bound map feel like it is fighting the user.
//  3. DEBOUNCE, ~300 ms, and never write a PROGRAMMATIC move. A `flyTo` is the app moving the map,
//     not the user choosing a view; writing it back mid-flight records intermediate cameras that
//     the user never asked for and that a reload would then restore instead of the destination.

// --- bounds -> camera, WITHOUT MapLibre's own fitBounds ------------------------------------------
//
// atlas-5's species camera (src/lens/species/data/camera.ts) hands the lens an EXTENT, not a
// center+zoom preset — a species surface has a real footprint, unlike a study-area preset. But
// `tests/map/no-fitbounds.test.ts` scans src/lib/map AND src/lens for a call to MapLibre's own
// bounds-fitting method (never named literally in this file's prose, on purpose — see that test's
// own regex), because it normalizes longitudes internally and inverts across the antimeridian
// (EBS/PIS). The species data layer's `minimalFrame()` already solved that
// by RE-EXPRESSING a frame so `east` may exceed 180 in a continuous (never wrapped) degree space —
// so the fit math here must stay linear in that same space and must never re-wrap it.
//
// This function is deliberately named `boundsToCameraView`, never MapLibre's own bounds-fitting
// method name (function name, method name, or call site — see this repo's source-scan gate): it is
// the plain Web Mercator projection that method uses internally (a linear x = lon/360+0.5, a
// standard non-linear y for latitude), computed by hand so a bbox with `east > 180` projects to
// `x > 1` instead of being wrapped back into 0..1 first.

 * a true sphere below roughly zoom 3, so "how much of the world is visible" is set by ZOOM, not by

 * sky" gap round 1 was chasing (a higher zoom renders a visually LARGER globe disc, covering more
 * of the free area, not less). `boundsToCameraView` never needed a cap or a boost: a bounds fit's

 * geometric middle of the WHOLE study area (Alaska through the Caribbean) for a near-whole-globe

 * crops down to a smaller patch of the SAME wrong place: measured live (production, 390x844,
 * `?tour=off`, no other change), the boosted camera is `lon -101.304, lat 33.509, zoom 3.01` and
 * the ENTIRE free area (top bar to sheet top) shows Canada/the Great Lakes -- 0% scored cells, 0%
 * recognisable U.S. coast. No shift or boost of that SAME point fixes it, because the point itself,
 * not the zoom, is wrong.
 *
 * P9's own fix (a tight northern-Gulf-of-Mexico/south-east-coast bbox, `[[-92,24],[-84,31]]`,
 * zoom ~4.9-5.2) traded too much away: it read as "one region of four" (Reviewers, round-3 plan
 * R3-A2) -- correct and recognisable, but Pacific/Atlantic/Alaska were nowhere in the first view at
 * all.
 *
 * **R3-A2 (Ben, 2026-09-25): "find an extent that includes at least the waters of the lower 48 and
 * ideally a sliver of Alaska (hinting at extent coverage there)."** Chosen BY LOOKING (bounded
 * iteration, real builds, `scripts/eyes-shots.mjs`'s `map`/`layers` phone states), starting from the
 * plan's own `[[-135,20],[-60,52]]` and narrowing:
 *   1. `[[-135,20],[-60,52]]` (zoom ~1.7 at the half-detent padding): framed CONUS + a real
 *      south-east-Alaska/Gulf-of-Alaska sliver at the top-left edge, but wasted roughly the bottom
 *      half of the free area on Mexico/Central America/northern South America with no scored
 *      content in frame.
 *   2. Narrowing the south edge alone (`south: 20 -> 26/28`) does NOT help: this bbox is
 *      WIDTH-bound (63-75 deg of longitude vs. a 390px-wide phone), so `boundsToCameraView`'s zoom
 *      is set entirely by the east-west span -- moving the south/north edges only re-centers the
 *      same zoom, it never tightens it.
 *   3. `[[-128,24],[-65,52]]`: trimming the WIDTH (west -135 -> -128, east -60 -> -65) raised the
 *      zoom to ~2.0 at the half-detent padding, while -128 W still carried the south-east-Alaska
 *      panhandle/Gulf-of-Alaska edge into frame and -65 W kept the whole Atlantic seaboard +
 *      Florida in. Verified live: the free area showed real coloured scored cells along the
 *      Pacific coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic/Florida shelf, WITH a visible tan/green
 *      sliver of Alaska hugging the top-left edge of the globe. This landed the first pass.
 *
 * SECOND PASS (orchestrator, 2026-09-25, after reading a real `phone-02-map.png` screenshot of step
 * 3 above): coverage was right, but roughly the TOP THIRD of the free area was empty navy "sky"
 * above the globe's own rendered rim -- step 3's own "the box's real geography already fills the
 * free area" reasoning undersold how much of that vertical space the globe's disk itself was NOT
 * covering at zoom ~2.0. Measured directly with `e2e/shell.firstview.phone.spec.ts`'s two-colour
 * (black space / white water) probe, as a PERCENT of the free area (not raw px against the whole
 * canvas, which extends behind the sheet): 43.0% sky at the default "half" sheet detent, 22.7% at
 * "peek" -- confirming the screenshot's own "roughly a third" read.
 *
 * Two things this pass established, both by direct measurement rather than the zoom formula alone
 * (`e2e/shell.firstview.phone.spec.ts`'s own header has the exact numbers):
 *   - The sheet's bottom padding has ZERO effect on the initial zoom here: this bbox is
 *     WIDTH-bound (its longitude span exceeds what a 390px phone can show without shrinking, well
 *     before the north-south span becomes the binding dimension), so `half` and `peek` measured
 *     IDENTICAL zoom and IDENTICAL absolute gapPx -- only the free area's own height (hence the
 *     gap's PERCENT of it) differs between them. Narrowing the bbox's own longitude span is the
 *     only lever that raises zoom and shrinks the sky band.
 *   - The relationship between span and the measured gap is NOT smoothly proportional to the zoom
 *     formula: span 43 measured 11.6% (half) / 6.1% (peek); span 40 measured 4.6% / 2.4% -- a
 *     "cliff", because the exact pixel the probe first hits depends on where land vs. open ocean
 *     sits at that specific latitude/longitude, not on zoom in the abstract.
 *
 * **`PHONE_DEFAULT_BOUNDS = [[-119,25],[-78,51]]`** (this constant, span 41, zoom ~2.59): narrowed
 * further than step 3, keeping the Pacific coast and Florida/the Gulf in frame (both explicitly
 * required) -- but a span this narrow cannot ALSO carry the Alaska hint (needs west out to ~-130)
 * or the Atlantic seaboard north of roughly the Carolinas (needs east out to ~-65) within the same
 * 10%-sky budget: narrowing FROM EITHER EDGE is the same lever (less width, more zoom, less sky),
 * so keeping all of "Alaska + Pacific + the whole Atlantic + Florida" was never possible once the
 * sky-band target is taken as a hard constraint. Per the explicit instruction ("if the Alaska
 * sliver cannot survive that, keep the full lower 48 with minimal sky and say so with the shot"):
 * the Alaska hint is dropped, and the Atlantic is ALSO trimmed north of the Carolinas -- a
 * corollary of the identical physical constraint, not a separate concession. Measured on the real
 * fixture: 7.0% sky at half detent, 3.7% at peek, both comfortably under the 10% target (live
 * screenshots: `phone-02-map`/`phone-03-layers-half`, round-3 W4 report).
 *
 * This DELIBERATELY does not chase the old "~3 floor" zoom heuristic P9's header below still
 * documents for the ORIGINAL bug (a near-whole-study-area bbox at zoom ~1.27 showing empty sky):
 * that floor was specific to a THIN default (a thin bbox or a boosted point) whose own frame
 * carries little real vertical content at low zoom. This bbox's own zoom (~2.59) happens to land
 * close to that old floor now, but that is a coincidence of what the sky-band target required here,
 * not a reason to treat "~3" as a rule -- the live screenshot is the proof, not a zoom number in
 * isolation (unchanged from the first pass's own reasoning).
 *
 * Never the whole study area's own bbox (Alaska through the Caribbean, ~114 degrees of longitude,
 * zoom ~1.27): even wider than this constant, and its own north-south span is dominated by open
 * ocean between the mainland and the Aleutians rather than a coherent coastline.
 *
 * Scoped to the DEFAULT first view only (`Shell.svelte`'s two call sites already gate on
 * `sel.area === DEFAULT_SEL.area`/no `sel.map`) -- an explicit `?area=`/`?map=` is never
 * second-guessed, and desktop is untouched (its free area is tall enough that the unboosted FULL
 * centroid already keeps real coastline in frame at the study-area preset's own zoom).

//
// The defect this fixes (owner report, 2026-09-24, live v7): `?area=AK` rendered the DEFAULT
// camera, not Alaska. Root cause was TWO bugs stacked: `Shell.svelte` resolved the initial study
// area against a literal `null` boot (`studyAreaFromBoot(null, sel.area)`), so it could never see
// a release's real `study_areas` rows; and the ONLY place that ever called `handle.flyTo(area)` was
// `LayersPanel.svelte`'s `onchange` handler — the panel BODY, which never runs for `sel.area` as it
// arrives from the URL on load (docs/map.md's 0.10.21 rule: a map input must be a lens/shell-level
// store, never panel-only UI, for exactly this reason — a collapsed/unmounted panel body must not
// be the only path a rule runs through). The fix is this pure decision, called from an effect that
// watches `sel.area`/`sel.map`/`boot` regardless of which tool/panel is open (Shell.svelte).
//
// Precedence (read this before touching the DEFAULT first-view camera elsewhere — e.g. a later
// round padding it for docked panel/sheet chrome in Shell.svelte/interaction.ts): an EXPLICIT
// `?area=` (a non-default key on the FIRST resolution once `boot` arrives) always wins over
// whatever camera framed the very first paint, default-fit padding included — the study area is a
// CAMERA, not a filter (CLAUDE.md), so a shared `?area=AK` link must always end up on Alaska. The
// only camera a `?area=` is not allowed to override is an EXPLICIT one — `sel.map` (a user's own
// pan, or a pasted `?map=` link) — same "camera preset applies only when `map` is absent" rule
