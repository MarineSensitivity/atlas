// walks the geometric grid, not the release's actual object list, so a box that touches land or
// runs past the populated footprint asks `AnalysisSources#cellTiles` for a `app/cell/tile={t}/
// data_0.parquet` that genuinely does not exist. S3 answers a GetObject on a missing key with 403
// (no ListBucket permission to disclose 404 vs "forbidden"), `engine/materialize.ts#fetchWithSizeGuard`
// throws `Error("fetch <url>: HTTP 403")`, and `engine.ts` normalizes every failure into
// `EngineUnavailableError("data engine unavailable: <cause>")` -- reproduced live (v7,
// `-170,50,-130,60`): `.../v7/app/cell/tile=593/data_0.parquet` 403s while its neighbours 588-592
// answer 200. `computeScoreResults`'s own callers used to show that raw, stack-shaped message
// verbatim (or, `Places.svelte`'s row chip, nothing analysis-specific at all -- see this module's
// header) -- neither says what actually happened. `describeAnalysisError` names the missing OBJECT
// (release-relative, not the whole `https://` URL) when the failure is exactly this shape, so a
// release gap reads as "analysis unavailable for this release: v7/app/cell/tile=593/data_0.parquet
// (HTTP 403)" -- a sentence that can be handed to whoever publishes the release, not a stack trace.
// Anything else (a WASM crash, a malformed query) falls back to the error's own message, unchanged.
