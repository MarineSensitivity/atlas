// places/studyArea.ts -- Deliverable 4 rule 10 ("must touch the release's study area (`in_usa`
// cells)") and D7b's clip, over a normalized place. This is the "caller's check" `geo/upload/
// normalize.ts` documents (`NormalizeOptions.studyArea`) -- but that hook's own type is SYNCHRONOUS
// (`(places) => Refusal | null`), while the real answer needs a network round trip (fetching the
// release's own `cell` tiles) through the engine. So this is NOT wired as that callback: it runs as
// a separate async step AFTER `normalizeUpload()`/`parseCoordinateEntry()` already returned
// `{ok: true}`, before the resulting places are added to `#pl=` -- the panel calls both in
// sequence, and the user sees the identical shape of refusal either way (a `Refusal`, rendered the
// same). `NormalizeOptions.studyArea`'s own doc comment says this hook is optional and "the check
// simply does not run" without it; running the SAME rule just outside that parameter is what the
// synchronous/asynchronous mismatch requires.
