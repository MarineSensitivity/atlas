/**
 * The actual link to copy, built from `newHash` (a `FitResult.hash` -- the geometry the panel just
 * ANALYSED and is showing the numbers for) rather than trusting `href`'s own `#pl=` to already
 * match it. Fix round 1 (Opus review): `fitPlacesToUrl` can return `status: "ok"` (or "long") with
 * `simplified: true` -- a rung DID have to run to fit the budget -- and copying `location.href`
 * verbatim in that case copies the ORIGINAL, unsimplified (and often far longer) link while the
 * dialog is showing the SIMPLIFIED one's length: a real link/number divergence, not a cosmetic one.
 *
 * P8 item 5 (Opus docs review, app finding #6): the fix above STILL did a plain string
 * substring-replace of `pl=<oldPl>` against `href` -- and that assumption ("every one of those
 * characters is already a valid, unescaped URL-fragment character") is false for the REAL address
 * bar. `formatSel` (`lib/state/codec.ts`) writes the hash through `URLSearchParams`, which DOES
 * percent-encode `~` (the multi-place separator) to `%7E`, and a place name's own internal "%20"
 * escape (a space, `encodeName()` in `lib/geo/placeCodec.ts`) becomes a literal `%` re-encoded to
 * "%2520". `oldPl` is always the RAW, undecoded g1 token, so with more than one place or a name
 * containing a space, the literal substring `pl=<oldPl>` never actually appears in `href` and
 * `.replace()` silently no-ops -- "Copy link anyway" then copied the FULL ORIGINAL link,
 * unsimplified, while the dialog's own summary showed the fitted length. Live-shaped repro:
 * `href = ".../#pl=g1.Big%20Box.AAA%7Eg1.Small.BBB"`, `oldPl = "g1.Big Box.AAA~g1.Small.BBB"` --
 * `pl=g1.Big Box.AAA~g1.Small.BBB` is nowhere in `href`.
 *
 * Fixed by never comparing strings at all: parse `href` with `URL`/`URLSearchParams` (which
 * decodes exactly the one layer `formatSel` applied) and set `pl` on the PARSED param bag, so the
 * copied link always carries the dialog's own fitted hash regardless of what characters it or any
 * other place in the (unread) old value contained. `oldPl` is kept in the signature for call-site
 * stability -- `URLSearchParams#set` already replaces-or-inserts on its own, so the "existing vs.
 * none" branch this used to need is gone.
