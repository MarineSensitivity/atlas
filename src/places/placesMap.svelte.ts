// places/placesMap.svelte.ts -- the ONE reactive bridge between Places.svelte and the shell's
// single `composeStyle()` call (docs/map.md: "one composed style, applied with ONE
// `setStyle(diff:true)`" -- Shell.svelte, not this module, owns that call). This is a `.svelte.ts`
// module (runes allowed, same convention as `src/lib/state/sel.svelte.ts`) rather than plain state
// inside Places.svelte, because the shell's `$effect` that recomposes the style needs to react to
// it too, and a value can only be `$derived` from a rune the reader can see.
//
// Everything here is DATA the shell folds into its `selection` composeStyle input (atlas-6's scope:
// "src/lib/map/ only through composeStyle inputs and the selection layer group") -- nothing here
// ever calls `addLayer`/`setStyle`/`fitBounds`.
//
// 0.10.21 (the same-class candidate fix 1 flagged, `e2e/places.deeplink-outline.spec.ts`): this
// store ALSO owns a BASELINE restore of a selected drawn place's outline, from `sel.pl`/`sel.sel`
// alone -- `model.ts#selectedGeomPlaceGeometry`. Before this, that restore lived ONLY in
// `Places.svelte`'s own `$effect` ("the selected row's outline persists..."), which runs only
// while the Places panel is mounted (Shell.svelte loads it lazily, keyed on `activeTool ===
// "places"`, never the default tool) -- so a deep link selecting a drawn place
// (`?sel=place:0#pl=...`) with the Places tool never opened showed no outline at all, the SAME
// shape as fix 1's scores-lens bug (map state computed only inside panel-gated UI). Shell.svelte
// already instantiates this store UNCONDITIONALLY, at module scope, regardless of which tool is
// active -- mirroring `createSpeciesLens`/`createScoresLens`, this is now "a lens/place-level store
// the shell instantiates", not panel-only UI.
//
// atlas-8 review round 2, item m3: that baseline restore used to be a SECOND `$effect` writing the
// SAME `outline` state `Places.svelte`'s own "the selected row's outline persists..." effect also
// wrote (gated on `!pickOn && !drawMode`) -- two independent writers of one bucket, ordered only by
// Svelte's own effect-scheduling, the shape GATES.md already flagged for `document.title` (fixed
// there by making Shell.svelte the ONE writer). Fixed the same way: `baseline` is now a pure
// `$derived` (never an effect -- nothing to race), `interaction` is the ONE piece of `$state` a
// caller can set (pick mode's highlight, a draw's live preview -- everything `Places.svelte`'s own
// `mapStore.setOutline(...)` calls already meant), and `outline` composes them ONCE, here:
// `interaction ?? baseline`. `Places.svelte` no longer needs its own baseline-restoring effect at
// all -- clearing the interaction override (pick/draw ending) falls straight back to the baseline
// this module already tracks; see that component's own `setOutline(null)` call sites, unchanged.
// A place/pl selection change drops any STALE interaction override (a pick highlight or a draw
// preview belongs to the selection that was current when it was set): pick/draw re-assert their
// own interaction immediately if still active, through their own callbacks. `tests/places/
// placesMap.test.ts` unit-tests the precedence.
//
// That reset effect surfaced a SECOND, newly-introduced collision while wiring item M1 (scores
// clicks dispatched unconditionally, regardless of `activeTool`): a scores-lens zone click during
// an ACTIVE pick session wrote `sel=zone:...` (its own selection), which this store's reset
// effect then correctly read as "the selection changed" and cleared the pick highlight `refreshOutline()`
// had just set -- the SAME click that was supposed to extend the pick set instead erased its own
// highlight. `interactionOwned` (below) is the fix: Places.svelte sets it while pick mode or a
// draw session has an EXCLUSIVE claim on map clicks, and Shell.svelte's one `map.on("click", ...)`
// listener skips dispatching to the scores lens' `handleMapClick` while it is true -- restoring
// the SAME exclusivity the old panel-mount-bound wiring gave Places by accident, without losing
// M1's actual fix (a scores click with the Places tool merely OPEN, pick/draw NOT active, still
// works).
//
// P7 fix (0.10.46, "drawn places vanish from the map after the second draw"): `baseline` used to
// be ONE place -- `model.ts#selectedGeomPlaceGeometry(sel.pl, sel.sel)` -- so drawing (or picking,
// or selecting) a SECOND place moved the map's only visible outline onto it and dropped whatever
// was drawn just before. `baseline` is now EVERY `kind: "geom"` place in the list, ALWAYS
// (`model.ts#allGeomPlacesOutline(sel.pl)`, keyed on `sel.pl` alone -- selection no longer decides
// what is drawn), and `composeOutline` is a UNION (pick mode's own live highlight / a draw's just-
// finished preview layered ON TOP of every already-listed place), not an override. See
// `allGeomPlacesOutline`'s and `composeOutline`'s own headers in model.ts.
