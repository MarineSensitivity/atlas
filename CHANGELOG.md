# atlas 0.1.1

- **Restricted releases can no longer render on the public host** (plan D6). `versions.json`'s
  `access` column is now enforced: v7b, v8 and v9 are restricted, and
  `marinesensitivity.org/atlas/?ver=v9` makes **zero** requests for that release — it shows
  `latest.txt`'s public release instead and records why on `window.__early.denied`. A restricted
  release renders only where the same-origin `session.json` says `preview: true` (the preview host).
  Unknown versions, a row with no `access`, and an unreadable `versions.json` all fail closed.
- **The registry and release files are read from the bucket, absolutely**, not from the page's own
  origin: `latest.txt`, `versions.json` and `{ver}/manifest.json` now come from
  `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/oceanmetrics.io-public/marine-atlas/`. This fixes the
  doubled-path 404 (`/v9/atlas/v9/manifest.json`) that made the preview host's version path fetch
  nothing at all. `session.json` remains the only same-origin request, and the public path no longer
  waits on it.
- New `src/lib/release/dataBase.ts` (the one place a data origin is formed; honours a validated,
  https-only `session.data` prefix on a preview session) and `src/lib/release/access.ts` (the gate),
  both unit-tested through the same case table as `index.html`'s inline early-fetch copy.

# atlas 0.1.0

Initial scaffold (plan phase `atlas-0`, Deliverables 1-5; the four de-risking spikes are a separate,
later change).

- **Project scaffold**: Svelte 5 (runes) + Vite 8 + TypeScript strict, no SvelteKit, no client
  router. Two build entries, `index.html` (map) and `report.html` (print-first report); `base: "./"`
  so the same `dist/` can run under both `/atlas/` and a version-prefixed preview path.
  ESLint (flat config) + Prettier, Vitest, Playwright (chromium/webkit/firefox) all wired up.
  `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm` and a `maplibre-gl` version are intentionally **not** added yet — those pins
  belong to spikes S1/S2.
- **`index.html` shell** that paints from static HTML + inlined critical CSS alone (brand top bar,
  tool rail, an empty panel skeleton, the four MMA hex colors as CSS variables) before any
  JavaScript runs, plus the inline early-fetch script that starts `latest.txt`, `versions.json` and
  `session.json`, then chains `{ver}/manifest.json` and `{ver}/app/boot.json`, all stashed on
  `window.__early`.
- **`src/lib/release/version.ts`** — version resolution (path beats `?ver=` beats `latest.txt`,
  `^v[0-9]+[a-z]?$`, matching `msens::atlas_resolve_ver()`) and **`src/lib/release/session.ts`** —
  preview-mode detection (a same-origin `session.json`; 404 or a network error is public, only a
  `200` with `preview: true` is preview). Both unit-tested; the inline early-fetch script mirrors
  the same logic by hand since it must run before any module import is possible.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`): `npm ci`, `tsc --noEmit`, `vitest run`, `vite build`, the
  size budget and two build-time invariant checks (below) on every push and pull request; a
  separate, elevated job publishes the checked `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch, only on push to
  `main`.
- **`scripts/size-budget.mjs`**: fails when the critical path exceeds 350 KB gzip, or when a
  lazy-only chunk (`duckdb*`, `terra-draw*`, `docx*`, `shp*`, the treemap) is reachable by a static
  import. `tests/fixtures/size-budget-static-duckdb/` is the committed fixture that proves the
  check can fail (a stub module statically imported on purpose).
- **`scripts/check-dist-session.mjs`**: fails the build if `dist/` ever contains `session.json`
  (that file must only be served by the preview host).
- **`scripts/check-relative-assets.mjs`**: fails the build on any absolute `/assets/...` URL in an
  emitted file.
- **Playwright smoke spec** (`e2e/shell.smoke.spec.ts`): the shell paints and logs zero unexpected
  console errors, on chromium, webkit and firefox. **`scripts/verify.mjs`**: skeleton state-matrix
  runner (desktop 1280×800 / phone 390×844, `assertLayout()` = no horizontal overflow, every
  `[data-control]` on screen) for later phases to grow into.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**, **`README.md`**, **`LICENSE`** (MIT, mirroring `apps`).
